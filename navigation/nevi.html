                <p>
                Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the
                 difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can
                 predict future events, such as regular walk times.

                <p>A study was conducted on dogs being away from their owners for
                     varying hours and the studies show that dogs who were away from 
                     their owners the longest showed the greatest amount of affection!
